# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the ActiveMQ CLI producer and consumer commands by adding missing configuration options that are available in the underlying ActiveMQ client libraries but not currently exposed through the command-line interface. The enhancement will provide users with more granular control over message production and consumption behavior, connection settings, and performance tuning options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer testing ActiveMQ applications, I want to configure connection-level settings through the CLI, so that I can test different connection behaviors without writing custom code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set connection timeout values
2. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure async dispatch settings
3. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set close timeout values
4. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable compression
5. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure prefetch policy settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance tester, I want to configure advanced producer settings through the CLI, so that I can test different message production scenarios and performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to set producer window size
2. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure async send behavior
3. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to set send timeout values
4. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable message copying on send
5. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to run indefinitely until stopped
6. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to pause and resume production
7. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure delivery delay

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to configure advanced consumer settings through the CLI, so that I can test different message consumption patterns and acknowledgment behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set receive timeout values
2. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure message selector filters
3. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set subscription names for durable subscriptions
4. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable break on null message behavior
5. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure retroactive consumer behavior
6. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set exclusive consumer mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure SSL/TLS and security settings through the CLI, so that I can test secure connections without modifying configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to specify SSL keystore and truststore locations
2. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set SSL keystore and truststore passwords
3. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure SSL protocols and cipher suites
4. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable SSL hostname verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure message transformation and serialization options through the CLI, so that I can test different message formats and transformations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable object message serialization deferral
2. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure trusted packages for deserialization
3. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable nested map and list structures
4. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to set custom message properties
5. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to display message properties and headers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want to enable statistics and logging options through the CLI, so that I can gather performance metrics and troubleshooting information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to enable connection and session statistics
2. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure audit settings
3. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set custom logging levels
4. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to display throughput statistics
5. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to display consumption statistics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a load tester, I want to configure advanced threading and batching options through the CLI, so that I can simulate high-load scenarios effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure thread pool sizes
2. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set task runner configurations
3. WHEN I use the producer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure transaction batch sizes with commit intervals
4. WHEN I use the consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to configure acknowledgment batch sizes with timing controls
5. WHEN I use the producer or consumer command THEN I SHALL be able to set connection recovery and failover options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility with existing CLI usage, so that existing scripts and automation continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use existing producer or consumer command options THEN they SHALL continue to work exactly as before
2. WHEN I use the help option THEN I SHALL see both existing and new options clearly documented
3. WHEN I omit new optional parameters THEN the commands SHALL use sensible default values
4. WHEN I use invalid combinations of options THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages explaining the conflict
